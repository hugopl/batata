# Batata ðŸ¥”

Batata is a Gnome/GTK4 opinionated terminal emulator for people that
need to have several terminals open at the same time and want to easily
navigate between them. Something similar to [Tilix](https://github.com/gnunn1/tilix)/[tmux]()/[Terminator](https://github.com/gnome-terminator/terminator)
but flavored to my taste.

## Demo

Here's an ugly demo where a forget to showcase that it support tabs too!!

# Why this name?

[Lucas Schulze](https://github.com/lucschulze) uses the word "potato" and/or "batata" as values for things when debugging stuff, everyone likes batatas.

# Current Status

As a _eat your own dog food_ enthusiast I currently using it every day, however it still
may eat your terminals.

- [ ] Fix Desktop::Widget known issues.
- [ ] Fancy widget to choose themes.
- [ ] Move widget from one tab to another when move(:left/:right) returns false.
- [ ] Show terminals from all tabs in `Desktop::Switcher` in different columns.

## Things that can be done after a first release

- [ ] Add support for translations.
- [ ] Finish safe-signals patch on GI-Crystal to avoid memory leaks here.
